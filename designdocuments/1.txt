Design goals

 - Separate VideoViewer component. This should be able to work without the server, excepting bookmark saving
    - frame step
    - loop
    - jump to bookmarks
    - should be able to view videos from a variety of sources, including web urls and local files
 - Searchable metadata (animator, show, episode)
 - Bookmarks to times in videos, with metadata
 - How to view gifs?


How to implement it
server responsibility:
    save video metadata.
    allowing searching of metadata.
    serve video from local disk.
    serve videoviewer files


client responsilibity:
    videoviewer responsilibity:
        display video and bookmarks
        be able to seek to a time, and set loop start and end time
        edit metadata
    serverhook responbility:
        supply video metadata and video URL to videoviewer.
        supply save video metadata function to videoviewer


Data types:
time: stored in seconds
video: a video URI+ a source locator (local file, web file, etc)
video id: server assigned unique ID to a video
video metadata: extra info about video: author, bookmarks, etc
video url: actual url that can be displayed in <video> html5 player

serverhook details
    - recieve video url from GET params
    - question: should localstorage and server be separate?
    - decision:
        unified metadata space. only video url is passed
        - tries to access all metadata sources
        - tries to save all metadata sources

videoviewer
    recieve element to populate
    state
        step rate
        video rate
    subelements
        bookmark editor
            clear active bookmark
            set currently active bookmark
            call setmetadata
            add/remove bookmark

        metadata editor
            clear
            loadmetadata
            call setmetadata

        status view
            flash forwards
            flash backwards
            call setplaybackrate


        video player
            state: currentTime
            set video rate
            step forward and back
            set loop
            note: doesn't handle events


server details
    save manager: save(video)
