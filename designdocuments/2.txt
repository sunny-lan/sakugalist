### Proposing new model:
main working copy stored on localstorage. sync with server.

current issue:
CORS makes it impossible for local file to work with server?

client side viewer always accesses localstorage by default

videoviewer<->local storage handler<->serverhook<->server

videoviewer: still same interface as before:
 - setmetadata(new metadata)
 - onmetadatachange (callback)

interface of localstorage
 - getvideolist()
 - getmetadata(url)
 - savemetadata(url, metadata)

interface of server
 - savevideolist()
